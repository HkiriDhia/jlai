## Fuzzy Logic, Machine Learning and Deep Learning with Julia

This repository contains slides, labs and code examples for using `Julia` to implement some **artificial intelligence** related algorithms. Codes run on top of a `Docker` image, ensuring a consistent and reproducible environment.

To run the code, you will need to first pull the `Docker` image by running the following command:

```
docker pull abmhamdi/jlai
```

This may take a while, as it will download and install all necessary dependencies.

### Included Algorithms
The repository includes implementation of the following algorithms:
>1. Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, k-NN, SVM, K-MEANS
>1. Fuzzy Inference System (FIS), Fuzzy Logic Controller
>1. ANN, CNN, GAN, VAE, NLP
>1. Transfer Learning
>1. Reinforcement Learning

### Prerequisites
You will need to have Docker installed on your machine. You can download it from the [Docker website](hub.docker.com).
