The repository contains the Dockerfile I use to create an image where students can run the labs of Machine Learning. I opted for `Julia` as the main programming language.

The latest image is built upon every push to this repo. Every update is available at [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/) via [abmhamdi/jlml](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/abmhamdi/jlml)
